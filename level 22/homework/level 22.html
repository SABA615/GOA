                <p>I have been studying in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nika11keshelava">GOA</a> for 3 months now. Here I'm learning programming, at the moment I'm taking html and python courses and I'm at level 22. It is a very friendly environment here. The mentors explain the lessons professionally, and all the leaders and mini-leaders try to help us as much as possible. Specifically, my leader is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cotne.gujabidze.9">Tsotne Gujabidze</a>. I also have two mini-leaders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100058033753316">Besik Gelkhauri</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009382572739">Davit Gzirishvili</a>.
