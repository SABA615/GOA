<h2>Ancient History</h2>
<p><b><i>Georgia's history dates back to ancient times, with evidence of human habitation found as early as the Paleolithic period. The ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia emerged in the western and eastern parts of the country, respectively. Colchis, known in Greek mythology as the destination of Jason and the Argonauts, was famous for its wealth and the legend of the Golden Fleece. Iberia, on the other hand, played a crucial role in the early Christianization of the region.</i></b></p>
<h2>Christianization and Medieval Period</h2>
<p><b><i>Christianity became the state religion in Georgia in the early 4th century, under the influence of Saint Nino, a woman credited with converting King Mirian III of Iberia. This event significantly shaped Georgia's national identity and cultural development. The Georgian Orthodox Church has since played a central role in the country's history.

    During the medieval period, Georgia experienced a golden age, particularly under the reign of King David IV (David the Builder) and Queen Tamar. King David IV, who ruled from 1089 to 1125, successfully unified the country and repelled invasions. He established a strong, centralized state and promoted cultural and educational advancements. Queen Tamar, ruling from 1184 to 1213, continued his legacy, overseeing a period of military success and cultural flourishing. Georgian literature, art, and architecture thrived during her reign, with notable works such as "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" by Shota Rustaveli.</i></b></p>
<h2>Russian Empire and Soviet Era</h2>
<p><b><i>In the late 18th century, Georgia sought protection from the expanding Russian Empire. In 1783, the Treaty of Georgievsk was signed, establishing Georgia as a protectorate of Russia. However, by the early 19th century, Georgia was fully annexed by the Russian Empire, ending centuries of independence.

    Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia briefly gained independence in 1918, establishing the Democratic Republic of Georgia. However, in 1921, the Red Army invaded, and Georgia was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Under Soviet rule, Georgia underwent significant industrialization and modernization, but also experienced political repression and purges.</i></b></p>
<h2>Independence and Modern Era</h2>
<p><b><i>In 1991, amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Georgia declared independence. The early years of independence were marked by political instability, economic hardship, and conflicts in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. These conflicts resulted in significant displacement and loss of life.

    Since the Rose Revolution of 2003, which led to a peaceful change of government, Georgia has made strides in democratic and economic reforms. The country has pursued closer ties with the European Union and NATO, although relations with Russia remain tense, particularly following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.</i></b></p>
